# CrystalCavern

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

Crystal Cavern is a game I had created alongside the GameDev.tv Instructors as part of a course that covered the Blueprint Node-based Programming in Unreal Engine 4

In it, the player assumes the form of a ball and must go around the entire dungeon floor collecting the crystals before entering the teleporter to move onto the next level.
